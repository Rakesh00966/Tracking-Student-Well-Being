# üéì Tracking Student Well-Being | Machine Learning [Link](https://github.com/Rakesh00966/Tracking-Student-Well-Being/blob/main/Tracking_Student_Well_Being.ipynb)

## üìò Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **students' stress levels** based on various mental, physical, and environmental factors.  
By analyzing data from the **StressLevelDataset.csv**, the goal was to identify the most influential parameters affecting student well-being and build a reliable machine learning model to classify their stress levels.

---

## üß† Objectives
- Analyze factors that influence student stress levels  
- Visualize relationships between features and stress levels  
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models  
- Select and save the best performing classifier for future predictions

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading & Inspection
- Loaded dataset using **Pandas**
- Checked for null values, data types, duplicates, and descriptive statistics  
- No missing or duplicate records were found  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization
- **Histograms:** Visualized distributions of `anxiety_level`, `self_esteem`, and `depression`  
- **Correlation Heatmap:** Analyzed relationships among all features  
- Identified strong correlations between stress level and features like **depression**, **anxiety level**, and **self-esteem**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Separated features (`X`) and target (`y`)  
- Performed an **80/20 train-test split**  
- Scaled data using **StandardScaler**  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training & Optimization
Trained multiple models using **RandomizedSearchCV** with **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation (k=5)**:
- Gradient Boosting  
- Random Forest  
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Decision Tree  
- Support Vector Classifier  

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
Accuracy, F1-Score, Recall, Precision, and ROC-AUC
